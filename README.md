# flash_cc2531
flash CC2531 USB dongle from your Raspberry, without Arduino nor CC Debugger.
Works also for CC2530.

CC2531 is probably the cheapest option to control zigbee devices from your raspberry with open source software like [domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/) or [Home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/).

## Requirements
This fork dropped obsolete wiringPi lib and requires regular libgpiod library.\
So install libgpiod2 and libgpiod-dev dependencies.

## More info
